# Augmented Super Mario 64

This project demonstrates how to use the [libsm64](https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64) project to render Mario in augmented reality using ARKit and Metal.

This repository does not contain any proprietary content. Some geometric data will be downloaded at build time if it is not already available locally. Additionally, you must supply your own Super Mario 64 ROM file (place it at the root of the repository with the name `baserom.us.z64`).
